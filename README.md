# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project explores the key factors influencing airline passenger satisfaction using supervised machine learning techniques and interactive data visualizations. Leveraging structured customer feedback data, we aim to build interpretable models that help airlines understand what drives satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To predict passenger satisfaction based on features such as service quality, flight experience, and demographics, and identify the most influential factors through model interpretability and visualization.
